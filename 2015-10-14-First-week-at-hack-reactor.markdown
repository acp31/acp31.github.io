I just completed my first week at Hack Reactor's remote beta online bootcamp! It has been a complete blur to say the least. We have learned so much in such little time it's hard to keep it all in my head. Even so I feel like my mind is turning to mush and tingling for more at the same time. 
It has been a better than I expected so far and even in the one week I've been apart of the program I have learned more than I could have learned in a month on my own.
So far we have covered foundational JavaScript, Data Structures, Algoritms, and Javascript Classes and Instantiation Patterns. So far I'm having a little trouble keeping things sorted in my head but even though I was struggling I am making progress. I feel like I am actually learning how JavaScript works and not just how to make things in JavaScript!
I plan to do a weekly post and a post when I stumble then figure something out. I think it could be useful as a learning tool for someone else who is brave enough to try to master JavaScript.
