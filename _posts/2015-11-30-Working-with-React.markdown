So I have been messing around with React and React Native. All I can say is that I am a fan.
React is so cool. It makes a virtual instance of the DOM and then updates the DOM when it needs
to be changed. This is so different from jquery or backbone becuase with those you have to place 
a listener directly in a specific place to make direct changes. This is kinda slow IMO because the 
program needs to keep looking and listening for changes. This way also kina pollutes the application with a bunch of functions and it can be hard to follow. If you are someone who is tired of backbone, jquey or maybe even Angular check out React!
